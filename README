Demonstrates code generation into style of smardda-qprog,
example of Braginskii plasma transport coefficients.

The relevant linux commands are
#compile and link program xpc
cd f95
make -f Makefile.xpc
#run test case
cd TEST
../xpc test2.ctl

Output will appear in 
smardda-misc/f95/TEST/test2_xpc.out
and should agree with
smardda-misc/TEST/test1_xpc.out

The files xpc.txt and clcoef.txt contain the key control and object variables for xpc,
and would form a basis for documenting the necessary inputs to the code (TO DO).
